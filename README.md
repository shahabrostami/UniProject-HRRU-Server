hrruserver
==========

This is the server that allows multiple connections using the hrruclient to connect and play.

To test, simply run the hrruserver locally and then run 2 instances of the hrruclient program.

The hrruclient programs can then simulate 2 separate players connecting to the server (using 127.0.0.1 as the IP)
and play the game.

Note: The code is in dire need of refactoring, however it is currently stable.

The aim of the project:
========================
Although there is a growing interest in books and published materials 
relating to rationality, there is an absence of software applications 
that provide an evaluation of a user's rational behaviour. This project 
aims to address this issue by creating a two-dimensional online 
multiplayer game which enables users to assess their rationality in 
various situations. 

The game implements a client-server network enabling simultaneous 
multiplayer game sessions with online capability. This project uses a 
board game approach providing a unique medium for users to 
participate in questions, play mini-games and receive feedback. This 
has been fundamental in providing a means of measuring userâ€™s 
rationality in an enjoyable and competitive environment. Testing has 
been conducted throughout this project ensuring that the final build 
of the game is bug-free, balanced and meets user requirements. 
This report will detail how the above has been achieved, the 
approach taken and the results produced, demonstrating that all the 
project objectives have been successfully met.
