<p>XYZ virus causes a disease in one in every 1,000 people.</p>
<p>A test always correctly indicates if a person is infected. </p>
<p>The test has a false-positive rate of five per cent â€“ in other words, the test wrongly indicates that the XYZ virus is present in five per cent of the cases in which the person does not have the virus. </p>
<p>What is the probability that an individual testing positive actually has the XYZ virus?</p>
